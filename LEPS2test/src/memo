- The global position of each layer is written in param/param_DetGeom001(_ana), but the current code does not use this information in Analyzer.

TrGeomRecord -- double WirePos(double wire) ->assign wire position by geometric calculation

<-> WireNumber (recover wire number from geometry)


This function is wrapped by  
double calcWirePosition(int lnum, double wire) in TrGeomMan class

The calcWirePosition is called in 
bool TrHit::CalcObservables( void )


CalcObservbables is called in 

bool TrAnalyzer::MakeRawHits( RawData *rawData) 

-------
TrAnalyzer::MakeRawHits is called in 

bool EventBeamTracking::ProcessingNormal(std::ifstream &In)  UserBeamTracking.cc

Note the RawData:MakeRawHits( std::ifstream ) is different function and does not provide geometry information

-------
the current clustering code

TrHitCluster::TrHitCluster( TrLTrackHit *hitA, TrLTrackHit *hitB )

just contain two hits found in TrLTrackHit ?
and the number of cluster.



------- 
TrTrackSearch is not a class, just defines track search algorithm.

int LocalTrackSearch( const TrHitContainer * HC,
		      std::vector <TrLocalTrack *> &TrackCont, 
		      int NumOfLayers, int MinNumOfHits )
is called in 

TrAnalyzer::TrackSearchSFTT( void )  

for SFT tracks.

TrAna->TrackSearchSFTT();  is used in the UserBeamTracking.
