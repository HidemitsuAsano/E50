//flow of fiber geometry

TrGeomRecord -- double WirePos(double wire) ->assing wire position by geometric calculation

<-> WireNumber (recover wire number from geometry)


This function is wrapped by  
double calcWirePosition(int lnum, double wire) in TrGeomMan class

//I think we do not need to create separate classes

The calcWirePosition is called in 
bool TrHit::CalcObservables( void )


CalcObservbables is called in 

bool TrAnalyzer::DecodeRawHits( RawData *rawData) 


TrAnalyzer::DecodeRawHits is called in 

bool EventBeamTracking::ProcessingNormal(std::ifstream &In)  UserBeamTracking.cc
